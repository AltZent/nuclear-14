  description: Prototype of a next-generation rifle that never made it into service with the US Army. Only a few units were delivered for special operations testing just days before the Great War began. Finding one in the wasteland is a real jackpot. It uses a unique caliber, so finding ammunition for it is an even greater stroke of luck.
